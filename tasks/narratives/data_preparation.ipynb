       "'Trump Lawyer Demands Accountability From Intel Chiefs Who Backed Hunter Biden \\n\\n An attorney for former President Donald Trump wants the 51 former intelligence chiefs held responsible for backing Hunter Biden in the unfolding story of the laptop abandoned in a Delaware repair shop.\\n\\nLawyer Tim Parlatore\\'s goal is to uncover alleged communications between the 51 former senior intel leaders and the Biden 2020 campaign.\\n\\nPolitico had reported that an Oct. 19, 2020, letter, signed by the former intelligence officials, outlined their assessment that a New York Post disclosure of emails allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden \"has all the classic earmarks of a Russia information operation.\"\\n\\nThose signing the letter included former CIA Directors Leon Panetta, Mike Hayden and John Brennan, along with former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.\\n\\nThe letter offered no evidence, but raised suspicions by the former intel officials.\\n\\nThe Post had previously reported that during the final months of the heated 2020 presidential race between Joe Biden and Trump, there were emails showing evidence of a possible meeting in the past between Hunter Biden, his father, and a Ukrainian energy firm linked to corruption. Joe Biden denied the meeting described took place.\\n\\nIn March of this year, The New York Times backed up portions of the Post\\'s reporting on the Hunter Biden emails.\\n\\n\"Those emails were obtained by The New York Times from a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop. The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation,\" the Times reported.\\n\\nNow, Parlatore has filed letters of complaint with the agencies that had employed the 51 former intel officials.\\n\\nThe letters cite \"an egregious breach\" by former agency employees \"that appears to have been overlooked by your agency, as it has gone uninvestigated and certainly unpunished. Specifically, the unauthorized publication and dissemination of an intelligence assessment, purportedly based on classified information that was used wrongfully to influence the outcome of an election.\"\\n\\nAccording to a Post opinion piece by journalist Miranda Devine, letters were sent to John Hollister Hedley, chairman of the Publication Classification Review Board at the CIA; Gen. Paul Nakasone, director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command; Christine Abizaid, director of the National Counterterrorism Center at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; Caroline Krass, general counsel, Department of Defense; and Avril Haines, director of the Information Management Division in the Office of the DNI.\\n\\nParlatore wants each agency to \"proceed immediately with legal action to [ensure] that such breaches of vital security provisions do not continue to go unchecked, the Post said.\\n\\nHis letter notes that each of the 51 former officials was \"bound by the lifelong obligation\" to submit the letter to their former agencies for pre-publication security review.\\n\\nParlatore is also expected to file a letter with the Federal Election Commission asking that the letter signed by the 51 former officials be considered a campaign \"in-kind contribution.\"\\n\\nThe Post noted that another step is for Parlatore to file a lawsuit as he seeks to establish a link between Democrat operatives and the controversial letter.\\n\\n'"

Guterres noted that economies outside the United States, europe, and asia would face worsening economic conditions. developing countries in africa, south america, and much of asia are seeing rising interest rates, he noted. “interest rates are going up extremely in the global south. countries are close to default. they have no resources because they couldn’t print money like the United States did, like europe did during the covid-19 [pandemic],” the UN chief told Bartiromo. “they have no access to concessional funding because many of them are middle-income countries. look at small island developing states, the caribbean islands.” some of those countries, he added, “lived on tourism” and “tourism has ended for two years, but as they are middle-income countries, they had no debt to live, they had no concessional funding.” Guterres said that the United Nations is proposing a global stimulus plan to address economic woes, and claimed that economies should transition from oil and gas to other energy sources. “we need to do that in a just way,” he said, adding that “this transition needs to be well-managed.” meanwhile, the west and China need to have “serious” negotiations amid the dim global economic outlook, said the UN chief. other warningswhile inflation has eased at the consumer and producer level in the United States in recent months, a number of economists and business leaders say that americans should prepare for a recession starting in 2023. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to their highest levels in decades in order to cool high inflation that reached more than 9 percent in june 2022, though it has since dropped to below 7 percent. “some economists argue that the strength of the labor market—as well as household balance sheets—will keep the economy strong enough to avoid a recession,” wrote Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji, co-founders of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, for CNN’s website. “we disagree,” they wrote, saying that “it remains our expectation that the U.S. economy will enter a recession this year.” “i’m confident that Microsoft will emerge from this stronger and more competitive,” Microsoft ceo Satya Nadella told employees in a memo on company’s website on wednesday.\\n\\n<PARA>other tech firms, such as Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Salesforce, and Twitter, have announced similar moves in recent weeks.
